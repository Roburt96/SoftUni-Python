Inheritance - extend the functionality of the code's
existing classes to eliminate repetitive code

Encapsulation - stop objects from interacting with each other so classes
cannot change or interact with the specific variables and functions of an object

Abstraction - isolate the impact of changes made to the code so the change
will only affect the variables shown and not the outside code

Polymorphism - allows different classes to have methods with the same name
